The front-end need the back-end API, to use it, you need to :

1- Launch the back-end first with: `npm run run:dev`

It will run in port 5678

Because of back-end running, you will encounter a message from the terminal 'Would you like to run the app on another port instead?' , choose 'yes' to run the front in another port
